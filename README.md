# London Housing Headlines

A visual comment on the property market insanity in London

## About the project
This project is a compilation of recent media articles about the housing market crisis in London. The idea emerged out of our personal experiences living in the city, as London rapidly changes becoming unaffordable to many of us.

The type characters are actual London buildings pulled from Google Maps. We realised the cityscape itself could deliver these messages, hoping that our collective dissatisfaction might lead to changes in the future.

Design and concept by [Kenzo Mayama Kramarz](http://kmkstudio.co)

## About the build
When I proposed building this to Kenzo, I thought it'd take me a couple of days, but then I decided to use a new stack, a get my head around *webpack* and *React* a bit more, which is not easy task.

The stack is actually quite simple, I use:
- webpack for my bundler and build tool
- React for the application
- Google Spreadsheet for the database
- [Ship](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ship) for deploying to *gh-pages*
